### Expedia is the online Travel to buy fresh fruits and vegetables, herbs and dry fruits.

We are travelers and technologists. We work across time zones, hemispheres, cultures and languages. We‚Äôre used to breaking things down and building them back up again, until they‚Äôre even better. We know travel can be hard, but we also know that it‚Äôs worth it, every time. And because we believe travel is a force for good, we take our roles seriously. We‚Äôre here to build great products, and facilitate connections between travelers and our partners that truly bring good into the world.
